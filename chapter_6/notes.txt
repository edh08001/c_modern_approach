*****LOOPS*****

while - controlling expression tested before loop body is executed
do - controlling expresssion tested after loop body is executed
for - loops that have a known number of iterations and decrement/increment a variable

break - jumps out of a loop and transfers control to the next statement
continue - skips the rest of the loop iteration
goto - jumps to any statement within a function
NULL - loops with empty bodies

controlling expression - the expression that is evaluated at some time during the loop. 
  0 (stop) or nonzero (continue).
loop body - the expression(s) to be executed should the controlling expression evaluate to nonzero
