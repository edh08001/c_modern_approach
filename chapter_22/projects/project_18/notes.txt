Option 1: scan each character in the document one at a time until EOF
    Pros:   One continuous while loop.
            No need to worry about line length.
            Can develop specific error conditions and checks.
    Cons:   More complex to build, as all edge cases need to be manually created.
            Potentially less safe as edge cases may be missed.

Option 2: use Fgets one line at a time, and then use a loop of sscanf for each digit until /n
    Pros:   Pre-built function is much easier to implement.
            Pre-built function should catch most edge cases and will be safer.
    Cons:   Need to enforce line size restrictions
            Nested while loops
